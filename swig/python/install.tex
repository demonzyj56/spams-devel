The SPAMS toolbox for Python is distributed in source mode only, and soon
on the PyPI website (at the moment available on the testing site:
\verb=pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ spams=).

It should compile on linux and Mac. A specific python compatible version
is available. We recommend to use the version designed for the Anaconda
Python distribution, to benefit from the MKL Intel library.

The installation procedure is described in the file \verb=INSTALL-package=
\begin{itemize}
\item Download the tar gzipped file, unpack it.
\item Enter directory spams-python
\item execute \\
  \verb;python setup.py install --prefix=<your-installation-dir>;
\end{itemize}

You have the choice of the BLAS library, but the Intel
MKL is recommended for the best performance.

If you want to add or change libraries, you must modify
the file \verb=setup.py=.

The documentation is available in pdf and html format in the \verb=doc= subdirectory.
